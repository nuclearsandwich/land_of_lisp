The Land of Lisp
================

*My journey through the Land of Lisp. Guided by Conrad Barski*

This is a collection, initially of games from the book [The Land of Lisp][1] but
I'll also be using this as my noodling repo for GNU CLISP and SBCL code.

Where I remember I note that the games come from the book and my say something
about a specific lesson or computer science concept the game showcases, but
really if you like what you see you should get Conrad's book.
